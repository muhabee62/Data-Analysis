Subsequently, employing the 'isna()' function, I identified and quantified null values within the dataset using the 'sum()' function, storing the results in the variable 'null_val_count'. Utilizing this information, I compiled a list of columns containing null values, which I stored in the variable 'null_columns'.\n",

    "Subsequently, I identified certain cells containing an \"unknown\" input represented by \"?\".
